# mTransSee_Dataset

This dataset contains the gesture samples used in mTransSee. 
This work utilizes transfer learning based method to reduce the dependence of tedious adaptation process of previous works which are sensitive to user habits and position changes of mmWave gesture sensing.
The dataset is collected by millimeter-wave (mmWave) FMCW radar as a benchmark for 5 gestures within 1.2 meters to 4.8 meters.

## Sample Gathernig

The dataset is used to explore the dependence of the following practical environment issues over previous works:

*1* user habits: 

In this dataset, we define 5 gestures for recognition to facilitate the natural human computer interactions in a real-world home scenario. Our gestures can be performed frequently and much easier than whole-body activities, especially for the senior. In addition to these predefined gestures, the dataset also archives random actions at random positions in daily life, which can be used as source domain to amplify target domain via the method of transfer learning in mTransSee. Specifically, the 5 gestures are as follows:
